Please ensure that your GitKraken Name and Email are correct. We need this
information to be able to grade you. Please use your TU/e email address.

You can set your Name and Email via your GitKraken profile:
GitKraken menu File > Preferences > Profiles > Edit Profile

Your GitKraken Name should be of the form: Given name followed by Family name.

E.g.:
   John F. Kennedy              should set Name to: John Kennedy
   Jeroen Adriaan van Eindhoven should set Name to: Jeroen van Eindhoven
   Isabella Ortega Moreno       should set name to: Isabella Ortega

We recommend changing also the following setting:
Preferences > UI Customization > Display author initials instead of avatars:
tick box. This will make it much easier to see who did which commit.
